Starting with version 1.0, it has become absolutely feasible to build complex languages of Xtext. One aspect of a complex language is usually support for expressions. Expressions require recursive grammar definitions, for which assignment actions in Xtext provide reasonable support. However, once you have expressions, it typically also need a type system. While it can be argued that type system checks are nothing more than constraints, building a reasonable type system is a lot of work that can use additional support over plain constraint checks. This paper describes a first cut at a framework for specifying type systems for (expression) languages built with Xtext.
